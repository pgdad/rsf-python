### v1.6 Ruff Linting Cleanup (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Fix all ruff linting violations and remove all ignored rules and exclusions so the entire codebase passes strict ruff checks with zero suppressions.

- [ ] **Phase 28: F401 Unused Imports** — Remove examples/ exclusion from ruff config; fix all unused imports across src/, tests/, examples/, and generated code (~61 violations)
- [ ] **Phase 29: F841 Unused Variables** — Fix all unused variable assignments across src/, tests/, and examples/ (6 violations)
- [ ] **Phase 30: F541 f-string Without Placeholders** — Convert all bare f-strings to regular strings (1 violation)
- [ ] **Phase 31: E402 Import Not at Top of File** — Fix or justify all out-of-order imports; clean up redundant noqa comments (6 violations)
- [ ] **Phase 32: E741 Ambiguous Variable Names** — Rename all ambiguous single-letter variables (2 violations)
- [ ] **Phase 33: E501 Line Too Long** — Shorten all lines exceeding 120 characters in examples/ (2 violations)
- [ ] **Phase 34: Config Cleanup** — Remove any remaining ignore entries, verify zero violations across the whole codebase

## Phase Details

### Phase 28: F401 Unused Imports
**Goal**: The entire codebase (including examples/) is linted and all unused imports are eliminated or justified
**Depends on**: Phase 27
**Requirements**: CONF-01, F401-01, F401-02, F401-03, F401-04, F401-05, F401-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `exclude = ["examples"]` is removed from pyproject.toml ruff config so examples/ is linted
  2. `ruff check src/` reports zero F401 violations
  3. `ruff check tests/` reports zero F401 violations
  4. `ruff check examples/` reports zero F401 violations
  5. F401 is removed from the `ignore` list in pyproject.toml
**Plans:** 1/2 plans executed
Plans:
- [ ] 28-01-PLAN.md — Fix all 61 F401 violations across src/, tests/, and examples/
- [ ] 28-02-PLAN.md — Update pyproject.toml ruff config (remove examples exclusion, remove F401 from ignore)

### Phase 29: F841 Unused Variables
**Goal**: All unused variable assignments are eliminated across the whole codebase
**Depends on**: Phase 28
**Requirements**: F841-01, F841-02, F841-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `ruff check src/ tests/` reports zero F841 violations
  2. `ruff check examples/` reports zero F841 violations
  3. F841 is removed from the `ignore` list in pyproject.toml
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 30: F541 f-string Without Placeholders
**Goal**: All f-strings that contain no interpolation expressions are converted to regular strings
**Depends on**: Phase 29
**Requirements**: F541-01, F541-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `ruff check .` reports zero F541 violations
  2. F541 is removed from the `ignore` list in pyproject.toml
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 31: E402 Import Not at Top of File
**Goal**: All import statements appear at the top of their files or carry justified inline suppressions; no redundant noqa comments remain
**Depends on**: Phase 30
**Requirements**: E402-01, E402-02, E402-03, E402-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `ruff check src/` reports zero E402 violations
  2. `ruff check examples/` reports zero E402 violations
  3. Redundant `# noqa: E402` in cli/main.py is removed
  4. E402 is removed from the `ignore` list in pyproject.toml
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 32: E741 Ambiguous Variable Names
**Goal**: All single-letter ambiguous variable names (l, O, I) are renamed to clear, descriptive names
**Depends on**: Phase 31
**Requirements**: E741-01, E741-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `ruff check .` reports zero E741 violations
  2. E741 is removed from the `ignore` list in pyproject.toml
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 33: E501 Line Too Long
**Goal**: All lines in examples/ that exceed 120 characters are shortened
**Depends on**: Phase 32
**Requirements**: E501-01, E501-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `ruff check examples/` reports zero E501 violations
  2. `ruff check .` reports zero E501 violations across the entire codebase
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 34: Config Cleanup
**Goal**: The ruff ignore list is empty and the full codebase passes strict ruff checks with zero suppressions
**Depends on**: Phase 33
**Requirements**: CONF-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The `ignore` list in pyproject.toml is empty (or absent)
  2. `ruff check .` exits with code 0 and zero violations reported
  3. The CI lint step passes on the final commit
**Plans**: TBD
