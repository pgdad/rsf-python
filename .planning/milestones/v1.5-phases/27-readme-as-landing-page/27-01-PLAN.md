<objective>
Update README.md to serve as a polished landing page on both GitHub and PyPI with status badges, tightened quick-start showing expected terminal output, absolute URLs for all links and images, and two hero screenshots.

Purpose: The README is the first thing users see on both GitHub and PyPI. It must show project health (badges), give immediate "copy-paste-and-run" instructions (quick-start), and render correctly on PyPI where relative paths are broken.

Output: A single updated README.md that satisfies all four README requirements.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite README.md as polished landing page</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Edit README.md with the following changes (preserve existing content structure, modify in place):

1. **Badge row** (README-03): Insert three clickable badge links immediately after the `# RSF` title line and before the tagline paragraph:
```markdown
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/rsf)](https://pypi.org/project/rsf/)
[![CI](https://github.com/pgdad/rsf-python/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pgdad/rsf-python/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
```

2. **Install instructions** (README-01): The existing `## Quickstart > ### Install` section already has `pip install rsf`. Keep it as-is. This is correct.

3. **Quick-start with expected terminal output** (README-02): Tighten the Quickstart section. After each CLI command block, add an unlabeled fenced code block showing the realistic terminal output based on the actual CLI source code. The sequence must show init -> generate -> deploy clearly. Specific changes:

   a. **### Create a project** — Keep the `rsf init my-workflow` + `cd my-workflow` commands. Add expected output block:
   ```
   Created project: my-workflow/

     + my-workflow/workflow.yaml
     + my-workflow/handlers/__init__.py
     + my-workflow/handlers/example_handler.py
     + my-workflow/pyproject.toml
     + my-workflow/.gitignore
     + my-workflow/tests/__init__.py
     + my-workflow/tests/test_example.py
   ```

   b. **### Generate code** — Keep `rsf generate`. Add expected output:
   ```
   Generated: orchestrator.py
     Created: handlers/validate_order.py
     Created: handlers/process_payment.py
     Created: handlers/send_confirmation.py

   Summary: orchestrator written, 3 handler(s) created, 0 skipped.
   ```

   c. **### Deploy** — Keep `rsf deploy`. Add expected output:
   ```
   Code generated: orchestrator.py + 3 handler(s) (0 skipped)
   Terraform generated: 6 file(s) in terraform (0 skipped)

   Running terraform init...
   Running terraform apply...

   Deploy complete
   ```

   d. Remove the verbose "Define your workflow" subsection (the full YAML example is already shown above in the "What is RSF?" section). Remove the "Add business logic" Python handler example subsection and the "Generate Terraform" subsection — the quickstart should be QUICK: install -> init -> generate -> deploy -> inspect. Move "Define your workflow" hint into a one-liner after the init output: "Edit `workflow.yaml` to define your states, then generate code."

   e. **### Inspect executions** — Keep `rsf inspect` command. Add one-line output: "Opens the execution inspector at http://localhost:8001"

4. **Hero screenshots** (README-04): Add two screenshots between the Features section and the Quickstart section under a `## Screenshots` heading. Use absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs:
```markdown
## Screenshots

| Graph Editor | Execution Inspector |
|:---:|:---:|
| ![Graph Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdad/rsf-python/main/docs/images/order-processing-graph.png) | ![Execution Inspector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdad/rsf-python/main/docs/images/order-processing-inspector.png) |
```

5. **Convert relative doc links to absolute** (README-04): In the Documentation section, convert all relative links to absolute GitHub URLs:
   - `[docs site](docs/)` -> `[docs site](https://github.com/pgdad/rsf-python/tree/main/docs)`
   - `[Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md)` -> `[Tutorial](https://github.com/pgdad/rsf-python/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md)`
   - `[DSL Reference](docs/reference/dsl.md)` -> `[DSL Reference](https://github.com/pgdad/rsf-python/blob/main/docs/reference/dsl.md)`
   - `[State Types Guide](docs/reference/state-types.md)` -> `[State Types Guide](https://github.com/pgdad/rsf-python/blob/main/docs/reference/state-types.md)`
   - `[Migration Guide](docs/migration-guide.md)` -> `[Migration Guide](https://github.com/pgdad/rsf-python/blob/main/docs/migration-guide.md)`

6. **Fix clone URL** in Development section: Change `https://github.com/your-org/rsf-python.git` to `https://github.com/pgdad/rsf-python.git`.

7. **Preserve all other sections** exactly: What is RSF, YAML example, Features, Architecture, Technical Stack, Requirements, Development, License.

Do NOT add any emoji to the README. Keep the tone professional and concise.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Validate README renders correctly for PyPI</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Build a wheel and run twine check to validate the README will render correctly on PyPI:

```bash
pip install twine build 2>/dev/null
python -m build --wheel 2>/dev/null
twine check dist/rsf-*.whl
```

If twine check reports any warnings or errors about the README description:
- Fix the Markdown syntax issue in README.md
- Rebuild the wheel
- Re-run twine check until it passes

Also do a final visual review of the README structure by verifying:
1. The badge row is on the line immediately after `# RSF` title (with a blank line between)
2. No relative paths remain in image or link references (except in-page anchors)
3. The Screenshots section uses a table layout for side-by-side display
4. Quick-start has exactly 4 subsections: Install, Create a project (or similar), Generate code, Deploy — each with command + output
5. The Inspect section is present after Deploy

Clean up the dist/ directory after validation (remove the wheel built for checking).
  </action>
  <verify>
`twine check dist/rsf-*.whl 2>&1 | grep -c PASSED` returns 1 (or the equivalent success indicator)
  </verify>
  <done>
twine check passes with no warnings. README Markdown is confirmed valid for PyPI rendering. dist/ artifacts cleaned up.
  </done>
