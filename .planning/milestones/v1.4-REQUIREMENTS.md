# Requirements: RSF

**Defined:** 2026-02-26
**Core Value:** Users can define, visualize, generate, deploy, and debug state machine workflows on Lambda Durable Functions with full AWS Step Functions feature parity — without writing state management or orchestration code by hand.

## v1.4 Requirements

Requirements for v1.4 UI Screenshots milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Screenshot Capture

- [x] **CAPT-01**: Playwright configured as dev dependency with browser automation support
- [x] **CAPT-02**: Scripts manage rsf ui/inspect server lifecycle (auto start/stop for each example)
- [x] **CAPT-03**: Mock execution fixture data created for all 5 example workflows
- [x] **CAPT-04**: Graph editor full-layout screenshot captured for each of 5 examples (saved to docs/images/)
- [x] **CAPT-05**: Graph editor DSL-editing screenshot captured for each of 5 examples (saved to docs/images/)
- [x] **CAPT-06**: Execution inspector screenshot captured for each of 5 examples (saved to docs/images/)
- [x] **CAPT-07**: Single npm script regenerates all 15 screenshots in one command

### Documentation Integration

- [x] **DOCS-01**: Each of 5 example READMEs embeds its graph editor screenshots (full graph + DSL)
- [x] **DOCS-02**: Each of 5 example READMEs embeds its execution inspector screenshot
- [x] **DOCS-03**: Tutorial 07 (graph-editor) updated with graph editor screenshots
- [x] **DOCS-04**: Tutorial 08 (execution-inspector) updated with inspector screenshots

## Future Requirements

None — v1.4 is self-contained.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Visual regression testing | Screenshots are for documentation, not automated diff testing |
| Video recordings | Static screenshots sufficient for documentation |
| Real AWS execution data for inspector | Mock fixtures avoid AWS dependency and cost |
| Screenshot CI pipeline | Manual npm script is sufficient; CI integration deferred |
| Animated GIFs | Static PNGs preferred for documentation clarity |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.
