# Phase 24 Plan 01: Embed Screenshots in Example READMEs and Tutorials

## Objective

Embed all 15 Playwright screenshots into the 5 example READMEs and 2 tutorial documents so users can see the graph editor and execution inspector without running the tools.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add screenshots to all 5 example READMEs

For each example (`order-processing`, `approval-workflow`, `data-pipeline`, `retry-and-recovery`, `intrinsic-showcase`), add a "Screenshots" section after the "Workflow Path" section containing:
- Graph editor full layout screenshot
- Graph editor DSL editing view screenshot
- Execution inspector screenshot

Image paths use relative refs: `../../docs/images/{example}-{type}.png`

### Task 2: Add screenshots to Tutorial 07 (graph-editor)

Add graph editor screenshots to `tutorials/07-graph-editor.md`:
- After Step 2 (Navigate the Editor Interface): order-processing graph screenshot showing the two-panel layout
- After Step 3 (Edit YAML): order-processing DSL screenshot showing the YAML editor alongside the graph

Image paths: `../docs/images/{example}-{type}.png`

### Task 3: Add screenshots to Tutorial 08 (execution-inspector)

Add inspector screenshots to `tutorials/08-execution-inspector.md`:
- After Step 6 (Explore the Execution List) or Step 7 (Time Machine): order-processing inspector screenshot showing the execution inspector view

Image paths: `../docs/images/{example}-{type}.png`

## Success Criteria

1. Each of the 5 example READMEs renders all 3 screenshots when viewed on GitHub
2. Tutorial 07 contains graph editor screenshots
3. Tutorial 08 contains inspector screenshots
4. All image paths are correct relative paths that resolve on GitHub
