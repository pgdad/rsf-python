# Plan 17-01: Cleanup and Documentation

## Objective

Write per-example READMEs and a top-level examples/README.md so a developer with no prior context can clone the repo, run one command to execute the full integration suite, and have zero AWS resources remaining afterward.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Per-Example READMEs (5 files)
Create `examples/<name>/README.md` for each example:
- order-processing
- approval-workflow
- data-pipeline
- retry-and-recovery
- intrinsic-showcase

Each README names which DSL features the example demonstrates and provides the exact command to run it standalone (both local tests and integration tests).

### Task 2: Top-Level examples/README.md
Create `examples/README.md` listing:
- All prerequisites (AWS credentials, Terraform binary, Python 3.13+, boto3>=1.42.0)
- Quick-start command sequence for the full integration suite
- Per-example summary table with links

### Task 3: Validate Teardown
Verify that the existing test harness (`terraform_teardown` + explicit `delete_log_group`) cleans up all AWS resources (Lambda, CloudWatch log groups, DynamoDB tables, IAM roles) after test completion. Document this in the top-level README.

## Success Criteria
1. Each example directory contains a README naming DSL features + standalone run command
2. Top-level examples/README.md lists all prerequisites + quick-start sequence
3. After integration test run, no test-created AWS resources remain
